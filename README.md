# Front-End-Web-Projects

Project 1 (HTML, CSS):
Given an image of a web page "original.png",  the task is to reproduce the page as closely as possible, writing HTML and CSS directly, that is without using anything more than a text editor. 

Project 2 (JavaScript, XML):
This project is to write a HTML/JavaScript program, which takes the URL of an XML document containing NASDAQ stock information, parses the XML file, and extracts the list of stocks, displaying them in a table. The JavaScript program will be embedded in an HTML file so that it can be executed within a browser.

Project 3 (PHP, eBay API):
Create a webpage that allows users to search items for sale on eBay.com using their API, and the results will be displayed in a tabular format.
